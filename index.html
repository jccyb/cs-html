<p>I'm currently a returning student at Cerritos College. I previously studied history and worked in retail before returning to study cybersecurity. I choose cybersecurity because I care a lot about privacy and how data collection, tracking and targeting works. Especially now, I think it's really important to learn how to protect your privacy. Hopefully I can get a career in this field.</p>
<h1>When I have free time</h1>
<ol>
  <li>I like to read about history and fashion.</li>
  <li>I like to visit cafes, libraries and museums.</li>
  <li>I like working on arts and crafts.</li>
</ol> 
<p>My favorite website is <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/">Atlas Obscura</a> because there's so many hidden wonders of the world to learn about. </p>
